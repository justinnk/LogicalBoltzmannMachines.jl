# LogicalBoltzmannMachines.jl

A (possibly faulty) Julia implementation of Logical Boltzmann Machines, as proposed by [Tran and Garcez](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.05841).

This project was made in the context of a university seminar to better understand and play with the ideas presented in the paper above and also to improve my Julia skills
