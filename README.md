# LogicalBoltzmannMachines.jl

A Julia implementation of Logical Boltzmann Machines, as proposed by [Tran and Garcez](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.05841).

This project was made for fun in order to improve my Julia skills and also to better understand and play with the ideas presented in the paper above.

## Usage
